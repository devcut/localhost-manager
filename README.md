# :floppy_disk: Localhost Manager

## Utilisation

If you are working on web projects and you have many projects on your machine, it becomes difficult to remember certain projects.
That's why I created this little tool that makes a list of all the projects that are on my machine and gives me the main project information (Github, Front, Admin, Framework).

## Installation

1. ```git clone git@github.com:devcut/localhost-manager.git```
2. ```composer install```
3. add website in your host file (:warning: Localhost Manager has been developed in Symfony [Symfony VirtualHost](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/web_server_configuration.html#apache-with-mod-php-php-cgi))
